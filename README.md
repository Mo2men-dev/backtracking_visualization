# Backtracking Visualisation

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to a computational problem, notably problems with constraints, it works by recursively building candidates to the solutions, and then abandoning a candidate when it hits a dead end (i.e. when it is clear that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution) which is called "___Backtracking___". This is a simple visualisation of this algorithm.
